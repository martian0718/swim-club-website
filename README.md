Website I developed for SCU Club Swim over Summer 2019 utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap

As a VP/Captain for the Swim Club at Santa Clara Unviersity, I took time over my summer of 2019 to work on creating a website for the team.
I created a website to help with exposure for the club, practice and meet information for club members, and to make club swim more accessible to prospective members.
